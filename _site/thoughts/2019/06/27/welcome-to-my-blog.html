    <p>I have always wanted to start a blog. For those tech-savvy people will know that I have registered this domain name in June 2018. Finally, close to a year of procrastination, I have decided to start my own blog. Those security analysts will know that previously, I am using a hosting service in Singapore, using WordPress to host my blog. In the end, I have decided to explore static website after hearing the benefits that come with it. I will do a write-up on how I build this website soon so stay tuned if you are interested in those sorts of things.</p>

<p>As you can see, I am a pretty technical guy. I love to explore new technology but I hope that this is not the only thing I will be writing about and hence, the blog name. This blog is about my journey, and even though IT is a big part of my journey, it is not the only part and I hope through this blog, I can share them with you.</p>
