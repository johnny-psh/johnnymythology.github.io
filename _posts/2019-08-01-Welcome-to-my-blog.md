Welcome to my blog! It feels weird writing the same post again since a month ago; I started my blog using the default theme for Jekyll. Since then, I code my theme because let’s be honest; the default theme is a little boring. I started by programming journey in secondary by attaining a Javascript certification from W3schools.  Since then, I have barely touched web design, focusing more on the back end. Back then, the trend is to use material design. I believe Google started implementing material design on Android at that point in time. I even coded the website used for competition using web starter kit (now Material Design Web). 
During polytechnic, I am always intrigued to start a blog to share some of my side projects. I bought this domain name during my final year of polytechnic along with a few clouds hosting services. They have me a good deal, hosting my blog using WordPress and an email server for barely 30 SGD per year if I remembered correctly. Closely to a year of procrastination later, I finally committed to starting a blog. 

I wanted a blog that does not charge any hosting fees, something with reasonable security. After a bit of digging around, I found Jekyll, a powerful static site generator supported by GitHub Pages. The default theme Minima, which as the name implies, is minimalistic. It does the job, however; I wanted a site where I can customize the layout to my liking. I stumbled upon Material Design Lite web framework, spent around one month (I couldn’t work on it during Weekdays. Work *cough*) designing the site and implementing Jekyll.
