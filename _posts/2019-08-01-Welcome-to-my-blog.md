Welcome to my blog! It feels weird writing the same post again since a month ago; I started my blog. Since then, I coded my theme because let’s be honest; the default theme is a little boring. I started by programming journey in secondary by attaining a Javascript certification from W3schools.  Since then, I have barely touched web design, focusing more on the back-end. Back then, the trend is to use material design. I believe Google started implementing material design on Android at that point in time. I even coded the website used for competition using web starter kit (now Material Design Web). 
During polytechnic, I am always intrigued to start a blog to share some of my side projects. I bought this domain name during my final year of polytechnic along with a few cloud hosting services. They have me a good deal, hosting my blog using WordPress and an email server for barely 30 SGD per year if I remembered correctly. Closely to a year of procrastination later, I finally committed to starting a blog. 

I gave myself a challenge, host a blog and email with no hosting fees. After a bit of digging around, I found Jekyll, a powerful static site generator supported by GitHub Pages. The default theme Minima, which as the name implies, is minimalistic. It does the job, however; I wanted a site where I can customize the layout to my liking. I stumbled upon Material Design Lite web framework, spent around one month (I couldn’t work on it during Weekdays. Work *cough*) designing the site and implementing Jekyll. It was fun, kinda reminiscence the reason I started programming. I love this theme so much that I opened source it for anyone to use the theme (https://github.com/johnnymythology/material-blog-jp). 

My previous intention for the blog is to share experiences outside of IT. After some consideration, I think I will stick to my old plan of strictly writing about my IT projects. Below is an old screenshot of my blog. Even though I only got to host it for a month, it is time to move to a better thing xD
