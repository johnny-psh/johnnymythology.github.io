Welcome to my blog! This blog will serve as a platform for me to share my project, experiences, and findings.

Some background information about me, I started my passion for IT during primary school where unlike my peers whom like to play computer games, I rather spent those times doing video editing and exploring the OS. Started my programming back in secondary when the smartphone craze started happening. Just to draw a reference about how long is that, the de facto programming language for making iOS application is Objective C and the default IDE for Android is Eclipse. I started with web programming before proceeding to making basic mobile applications. After attending a cyber security competition, I decided that this is the path I want to go. Fast forward to today, I have done some security-related side projects and is awaiting university admission. Even though I am focusing more on cyber security, I still like to explore other technologies such as machine learning, data science, and so on. 

The web framework for this blog is Material Design Lite. Jekyll is the static site generator, using the material-blog-jp theme (Created by me). This website is hosted on GitHub Pages.
