Welcome to my blog! This blog will serve as a platform for me to share my project, experiences, and findings.

Some background information about me, I started my passion for IT during primary school where unlike my peers whom like to play computer games, I rather spent those times doing video editing and exploring the OS. Started my programming back in secondary when the smartphone craze started happening. Just to draw a reference about how long is that, the de facto programming language for making iOS application is Objective C and the default IDE for Android is Eclipse. I started with web programming before proceeding to making basic mobile applications. Decided to choose cyber security industry as my area of focus in polytechnic (Pre-Uni). Besides cyber security, I enjoy Artificial Intelligence. After my national service obligation, I have decided to further my studies at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Computer Science.

The web framework for this blog is Material Design Lite. Jekyll is the static site generator, using the material-blog-jp theme (Created by me). This website is hosted on GitHub Pages.
