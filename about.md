Welcome to my blog! This blog will serve as a platform for me to share my project, experiences, and findings.

The name of the blog is Mythical Odyssey, which is split into two parts, Mythical and Odyssey. The Odyssey for those do not know was a poem written by Homer about the journey of Geek hero Odysseus. I hope that this blog will be a reflection of my journey.

The web framework for this blog is Ruby on Rails. Jekyll is the static site generator, using the default theme (Minima). This website is hosted on GitHub Pages. Visit my GitHub to view the source code.
